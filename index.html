<h1>Matthew Smith's Webpage</h1>
<p>Welcome to my webpage!</p>
<br>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm a first-year MLIS student specializing in Media Archives. This class has me thinking that I need to get ready to jack in to the overwhelming cyberspace of the world wide web. Ironically, the part I'm <em>still</em> most anxious about is the <strong>group project</strong>. Hopefully, I've joined a group by the end of Week 2.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Elements and Changes</h3>
<p>I added two new texts that I found by Google. I centered everything, changed the colors of the text and background. I gave the image below a border, added a link to the artist's Instagram page in the image, and added a caption crediting him. I also added a soundtrack from Spotify.</p>

            "explanation": "This supernova shock wave plows through interstellar space at over 500,000 kilometers per hour. Centered and moving upward in the sharply detailed color composite its thin, bright, braided filaments are actually long ripples in a cosmic sheet of glowing gas seen almost edge-on. Discovered in the 1840s by Sir John Herschel, the narrow-looking nebula is sometimes known as Herschel's Ray. Cataloged as NGC 2736, its pointed appearance suggests its modern popular name, the Pencil Nebula. The Pencil Nebula is about 800 light-years away. Nearly 5 light-years long it represents only a small part of the Vela supernova remnant though. The enormous Vela remnant itself is around 100 light-years in diameter, the expanding debris cloud of a star that was seen to explode about 11,000 years ago. Initially, the section of the shock wave seen as the Pencil nebula was moving at millions of kilometers per hour but has slowed considerably, sweeping up surrounding interstellar material.",
