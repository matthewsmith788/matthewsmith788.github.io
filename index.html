<h1>Matthew Smith's Webpage</h1>
<p>Welcome to my webpage!</p>
<br>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm a first-year MLIS student specializing in Media Archives. This class has me thinking that I need to get ready to jack in to the overwhelming cyberspace of the world wide web. Ironically, the part I'm <em>still</em> most anxious about is the <strong>group project</strong>. Hopefully, I've joined a group by the end of Week 2.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Elements and Changes</h3>
<p>I added two new texts that I found by Google. I centered everything, changed the colors of the text and background. I gave the image below a border, added a link to the artist's Instagram page in the image, and added a caption crediting him. I also added a soundtrack from Spotify.</p>
